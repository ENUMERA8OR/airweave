# Airweave Frontend Guidelines

## Tech Stack & Structure
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS with ShadCN UI components
- Radix UI primitives with Lucide icons
- File-based routing with React Router
- Pages → `src/pages/`, Components → `src/components/`

## Component Patterns
- Use TypeScript for all components with proper interfaces
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Shared UI components in `components/ui/`
- Domain-specific components in named directories
- Use props spreading with explicit typing

## Styling Approach
- TailwindCSS with class variance authority (cva)
- Use `cn()` utility for class name merging
- Consistent theming with CSS variables
- Component variants defined with cva

## API & Data Fetching
- Use apiClient from `src/lib/api.ts`
- Relative endpoint paths (no `/api/v1` prefix)
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Proper error handling with toast notifications

## State Management
- React Query for server state
- React Context for global UI state
- Local state with `useState`/`useReducer` hooks
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/` for shared logic
